Some Jekyll themes are gem-based meaning that parts of the theme are kept seperate from the site's main directory in a *gem*. That way the gem can get updates from the developer without affecting the content of the site.

If you are using a gem-based Jekyll theme, there are a few reasons you might want to keep the original gem intact when you modify the theme. One reason is that you will have a backup incase something goes wrong. Another is that you will be able to get updates from the developer without loosing cusotomizations.
