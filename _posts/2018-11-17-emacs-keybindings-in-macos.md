title: Emacs Keybindings in MacOS
---
At work, I was given the choice between a MacOS or a Windows machine. My default answer is to take the Windows machine and put Linux on it. In this case, that wasn't a practical option. What I ended up with is a MacBook Air *and* a Windows Desktop. Overall, I'm indifferent about these OS's and approach both with a bit of cynicism. Apple makes beautiful, expensive things that redefine the word proprietary. Windows is a more accessible mess. For all of it's many faults, the only OS that I feel any loyalty towards is Linux.

But since I started using the MacBook Air for work, I realized something that makes choosing between MacOS and Windows much easier. MacOS natively supports some of the more prominent emacs keybindings when editing text fields. I realized it when I was editing a Google Doc and I instictively pressed `Ctrl-p` to move the cursor up a line and it worked. At first I thought that they must have changed Google Docs. But the next time I was using Docs on the Windows machine it didn't work. So I looked it up. [Sure enough](https://jblevins.org/log/kbd), those keybindings are built into MacOS.

To me, this seems as good of a reason as any to prefer on OS to the other. I am currently trying to trade my Windows Desktop for an older iMac.
