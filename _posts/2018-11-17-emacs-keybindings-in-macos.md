At work, I was given the choice between a MacOS or a Windows machine. My default answer is to take the Windows machine and put Linux on it. In this case, that wasn't a practical option. What I ended up with is a MacBook Air *and* a Windows Desktop. Overall, I'm indifferent to these OSs and approach both with a bit of cynicism. Apple makes beautiful, expensive things that redefine the word proprietary. Windows is a more accessible ad-driven mess. For all of it's many faults, the only OS that I feel any loyalty towards is Linux.

But since I started using the MacBook Air for work, I realized something that makes choosing between MacOS and Windows a bit easier. MacOS naively supports some of the fundamental Emacs keybindings when editing text fields. I realized it when I was editing a Google Doc and I reflexively pressed `Ctrl-p` to move the cursor up a line and it worked. I don't mean to overstate but when it happened, the clouds parted and a single ray of sun shone down upon my caps lock key (which is switched to Ctrl). I even had a sense that somewhere, St. IGNUcius gave a begrudging nod.

I assumed Google Docs had starting supporting the keybindings. I promptly told several people who politely pretended to care. But the next time I was using Docs on a Windows machine it didn't work. So I looked it up. [Sure enough](https://jblevins.org/log/kbd), those keybindings are built into MacOS. That means that these bindings work in *any* text field on MacOS.

Even though it sounds like a joke about RMS and Steve Jobs sharing an elevator, if you are someone who is comfortable with the cursor movement in Emacs, this seems as good of a reason as any to prefer one of these OSs to the other.
