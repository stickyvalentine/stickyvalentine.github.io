I have tried many times to maintain some sort of blog or personal website. This is another such attempt. My strategy this time is to make a place to write notes to my self against the time when I will inevedibly forget how I did the things I did. There will probably be some word-vomity brain-dumps as well. 

There is a good chance this blog will be abandoned not very long after my third post or so. Let the countdown begin!
