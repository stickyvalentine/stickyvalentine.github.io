I'm Ben. I have tried many times to maintain some sort of blog or personal website. This is another such attempt. My strategy this time is to make a place to write notes to my self against the time when I will inevedibly forget how I did the things I did.

I work at Western Oregon University as an LMS Support Specialist. In practical terms, I help people use Moodle.

This is also a chance for me to try out Jekyll and github pages. I really like the idea of maintaining a blog using not much more than emacs and git. For now I am going to keep the default theme because I think it suits me perfectly. Maybe that will change at some point.

There is a somewhat high prbability that this blog will be abandoned not very long after my third post or so. Let the countdown begin!
